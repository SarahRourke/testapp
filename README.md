Simple aws amplify app built with react and graphql for backend data.

This is the first app in my aws self-challenge. I want to spend the next year or so going over each aws resource/service (or as many as I can manage).


The build process was very simple. Streamlined continuous integrated deploys.

Desktop based and less handtyped code.
